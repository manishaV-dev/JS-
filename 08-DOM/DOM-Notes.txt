1. DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements
from the document. 
We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.

The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.


2. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
                                                                    
        With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

                i.   JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
                ii.  JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
                iii. JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
                iv.  JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
                v.   JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
                vi.  JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
                vii. JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

What is DOM:
    The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
    The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
    "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to 
    dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents

What is the HTML DOM?
        The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

            i.      The HTML elements as objects
            ii.     The properties of all HTML elements
            iii.    The methods to access all HTML elements
            iv.     The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.



3. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can 
    change the document structure, style, and content.
