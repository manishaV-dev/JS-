// Arrays = An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

/*

Notes :     1. JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. 
            2. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed
            3. JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies rather than deep copies. (Stack and Heap)
