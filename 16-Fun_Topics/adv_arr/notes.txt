##Packed Array
A packed array is a type of array where each element is stored contiguously in memory. This means there are no gaps or "holes" between the elements. 
Every index in the array directly corresponds to an element, and the memory usage is as efficient as possible given the size of the elements and the array.

##Advantages:
      i. Memory Efficiency: No unused space between elements.
      ii. Cache Performance: Better use of CPU cache lines due to contiguous memory, leading to faster access times.
      iii. Predictable Performance: Access times are consistent and predictable because the memory layout is simple.

##Disadvantages:
      i. Fixed Size: The array size is often fixed at the time of allocation, making it less flexible.
      ii.Resizing Overhead: If the array needs to grow, it often requires creating a new array and copying all elements, which can be expensive in 
          terms of time and memory.

##Use Cases:
      i. Situations where the array size is known and remains constant.
      ii. Performance-critical applications where predictable access times are crucial.
      iii. Implementations requiring high memory efficiency.

##Holey Array
A holey array (also known as a sparse array) is an array that allows for gaps or "holes" where some indices might not have an element assigned. 
In such arrays, not all indices between the first and the last are necessarily populated with values.


##Advantages:
            i. Flexibility: Can efficiently handle cases where only a few indices are used out of a potentially large range.
            ii. Dynamic Resizing: Easier to grow and shrink dynamically since gaps can exist.
            iii. Sparse Data Representation: Useful for scenarios where data is sparse, avoiding the need to allocate memory for unused indices.


##Disadvantages:
            i. Memory Overhead: May require additional structures (like hash tables or linked lists) to manage the gaps, which can lead to increased memory usage.
            ii. Access Performance: Accessing elements may be slower due to the need to handle the gaps and potential additional indirection.
            iii. Complexity: More complex memory management and element access logic compared to packed arrays.

##Use Cases:
            i. Situations where the array is sparsely populated.
            ii. Cases where the maximum array size is large but only a few elements are actually used.
            iii. Scenarios where elements are frequently added and removed dynamically.
