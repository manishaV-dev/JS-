1. Do JavaScript really have classes?
Ans - Yes, JavaScript has classes. Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. However, it's important to note that JavaScript is primarilt a 'Prototype-based' language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms.

he class syntax in JavaScript provides a way to create objects and handle inheritance in a more structured and clear manner compared to the earlier prototype-based approach.


<!-- class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the class
const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old. -->


    Key Features of JavaScript Classes : 
            i.   Constructor: The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
            ii.  Methods: Functions defined within a class. In the example above, greet is a method.
            iii. Inheritance: Classes can inherit from other classes using the extends keyword.


<!-- class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog1 = new Dog('Rex', 'Labrador');
dog1.speak(); // Output: Rex barks. -->

explanation :- In this example, the 'Dog' class extends the 'Animal' class, inheriting its properties and methods. The 'speak' method in the 'Dog' class 
                overrides the 'speak' method in the 'Animal' class.


Understanding the Prototype Chain :-
Although classes in JavaScript use a more familiar syntax to developers coming from other object-oriented languages, under the hood they are still using the prototype-based inheritance that JavaScript is built on. The class syntax is essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model.


Conclusion
So, while JavaScript has classes in the sense of the ES6 class syntax, it's important to understand that they are built on top of the language's existing prototype-based system. This means they provide a more intuitive and structured way to handle object-oriented programming in JavaScript, but they do not fundamentally change the way the language works.
